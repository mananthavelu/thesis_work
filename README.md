An evaluation of independent component analyses with an application to resting-state Electrocorticography(ECoG)

I n this thesis work, different number of Independent Components Analysis(ICA)
algorithms are applied to resting state Electrocorticography (ECoG) data on five
different human subjects. At first, the total number of independent components are
validated with the help of an already established method in which the randomization
of initial parameters in combination with bootstrapping of the samples followed by
clustering was used. Once the total number of cortical sources are evaluated, the
comparison has been made between FastICA, JADE, SOBI, Pearson, InfoMax, and
OGWE algorithms using the measures of independence which are, the reduction in

the mutual information for statistical independence and Spearman correlation coeffi-
cient for linear independence between the components. The estimated independent

components from each algorithm, are ordered in the magnitude of non-gaussianity for
importance with the help of measures namely, Entropy and Kurtosis. The results are
discussed while taking into account the individual functioning of each ICA algorithm
and its specific goal of optimization.
